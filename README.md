# Sailsforce Point Bot

## Motive of the project
My department was forcing everyone to do salesforce point and told us to do 50,000 points in few days, everyone was googling and comleting the task

So, I autimated the whole process using puppeteer a javascript library for web scrapping.

## Authentication 

I made the project in hurry, for authentication i have added a waiting time for 120 sec so that you can authenticate into your trailhead account.

Make sure that headless mode is false so that browser window will appear and you can authenticate.


## How to run this project .
To start the project run 
```npm install ``` in the root directory and then ```node index.js``` .
